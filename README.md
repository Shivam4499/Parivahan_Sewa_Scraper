# RCDL Scraper

This Python program allows users to scrape data from the Regional Transport Office (RTO) website of the Government of India related to driving license (DL) information. It utilizes web scraping techniques to extract various details such as DL status, holder's name, validity dates, class of vehicle details, etc., by making HTTP requests and parsing HTML content.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `lxml`, `PIL`

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository containing the Python script.
2. Ensure that Python and required libraries are installed.
3. Run the Python script (`rcdl_scraper.py`).
4. The program will prompt you to input the DL number and date of birth (DOB) in the specified format (DD-MM-YYYY).
5. After providing the necessary inputs, the program will display the CAPTCHA image fetched from the website and prompt you to input the CAPTCHA value.
6. Upon successful input of the CAPTCHA, the program will scrape the data from the website and display the extracted information in JSON format.

## Program Structure

- `RCDLScraper` class:
  - `__init__`: Initializes the scraper with the CAPTCHA URL and data URL.
  - `scrape_data`: Method to scrape DL data by sending POST requests, parsing HTML content, and organizing the extracted data into a structured JSON format.

- Main block:
  - Defines CAPTCHA URL and data URL.
  - Creates an instance of `RCDLScraper`.
  - Prompts the user to input DL number and DOB.
  - Calls the `scrape_data` method to scrape and display the DL information.

## Notes

- This program is designed to scrape data specifically from the RTO website of the Government of India. Any changes in the website structure may affect the functionality of the scraper.
- Ensure compliance with legal and ethical guidelines when using web scraping techniques.

# Continuation of Readme Code

## Error Handling

- The program includes error handling to manage scenarios such as failure to identify the CAPTCHA image, unsuccessful retrieval of data from the website, etc.
- If an error occurs during execution, appropriate error messages are displayed to guide the user.

## Customization

- Users can customize the program by modifying the CAPTCHA URL, data URL, and other parameters as per their requirements.
- Additionally, the XPath expressions used to extract specific data from the HTML can be adjusted based on any changes in the website's structure.

## Dependencies

- The program relies on external libraries such as `requests`, `lxml`, and `PIL`. Ensure that these libraries are installed using pip (`pip install requests lxml pillow`).

## Security Considerations

- Web scraping involves accessing and extracting data from websites. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to scrape data from the target website.
- Be cautious when handling sensitive information such as DL numbers and DOB. Avoid storing or transmitting such data insecurely.
